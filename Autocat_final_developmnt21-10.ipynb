Developed by the French start-up HOSTABEE in 2015, the connected module, associated with a web application, allows beekeepers to remotely follow the life cycle of their bee colonies. This module, which adapts to all types of hive (Dadant, Langstroth ...), measures in particular the temperature and humidity of the hives. How it works ?  The module installs either on a hive frame or between two ruhe frames.  Every hour, the data of the hive are sent (radio technology, innocuous for the bees), stored and analyzed on a website or on your phone.  Thanks to this solution, we are able to know from a distance:  - The activity of the colony, such as stopping and resuming spawning  - The absence of nectar ingress which allows to optimize and target the interventions in the apiary.

       "   \"The 500 Series is broad portfolio of air/gas, liquid and surface temperature probes that use Honeywell's NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. Thermistors can be very effective in sensing temperatures of gases, liquids or solids because of their enhanced sensitivity. These small, easy to install probe assemblies support and position the thermistor elements within the media to be monitored as well as protect the thermistors against damage in use or handling. The assemblies also help direct thermal or fluid flow evenly across the thermistors for accurate temperature sensing. The enhanced reliability, precision and stability of the 500 Series products allow the customer greater flexibility in temperature monitoring and control. The wide operating temperature range is -60 °C to 300 °C [-76 °F to 572 °F] provides application flexibility. The 500 Series is available in a wide variety of housing styles and materials, R-T (Resistance-Temperature) curves, mounting methods, mechanical interface, electrical interface and connector types to meet most applications. In addition to custom configurations, a variety of existing designs is available. Honeywell also offers RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) technology that may be packaged into probe assemblies for similar applications that may require an RTD linear output instead of an NTC thermistor output.               \",\n",

Natively capable of communicating in private Clover-Net RF and public LoRaWAN networks, the device is able to enlarge its working area.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Several features ease the commissioning and allow advanced management functionalities without requiring specific tools, like a push button,\\xa0 a bicolor LED indicating the device status locally, or even configuration through NFC.  An attached sensor and open case detection advise\\xa0 from any tamper tentative. Basic inputs, but customizable purposes Basically offering 4 active 0-5V analog 12-bit resolution inputs and a couple of 100Hz capable pulse-counting, its framework can support other industrial probe management (on-demand). Moreover, embedded temperature and ambient pressure sensors add values to the reports.  In specific use-cases, it can also manage digital outputs (pulse mode in battery-powered, continuous if main-powered). Advanced features When mechanical switches are connected to the counting inputs, a debouncing software filter can be activated to avoid faulty pulses. For all analog inputs and internal sensors, multiple sampling and dedicated configurable linear measure correction give a reliable read-to-use data. All events in the device are stored in a readable table as well as each sensor reading. Alarms can be triggered by event (tamper…) or threshold limit measurement. Data is periodically sent as a spontaneous message or on-demand, either in Clover-Net or LoRaWAN protocol. Seasonal schedules management and its 2 A size batteries make the device life time longer than ever.  Furthermore, other functionalities like Over The Air (OTA) firmware update or device usage management insure over time device full-featured and preventive maintenance operations. High level protection Designed to be hostile environment proof, their IP66 (potted IP68 in option) and IK08 protections added to flammability UL 94 HB give to this device the ability to be used in most constrained conditions, even with outgoing wires thanks to its IP67 grommets and O-ring seal.

Sensor vendors can speed up their LPWAN integration by embedding this module in their designs. This module will take care of the LPWAN communication with our LPWAN AP and cloud services. There are different integration options: the sensor design can integrate this SMT module via AT command set treating this module as a GPRS modem replacement; the interface can be via Modbus interface; and the sensor can be automatically controlled by the MCU of the module through using “Report” mode. The main function of the LoRa SiP module that contains a long range data link is that it can be used for sensor integration. For those users of sensors it allows them to speed up their Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) integration by embedding the module in their designs. There a different integration options that one can use to meet their needs: Using AT Commands The interface can be used as a Modbus interface The sensor can automatically be controlled by the MCU using the 'Report' functionality.

More so, it allows organizations to \\xa0become – Agile, Intelligent and Adaptive.\\xa0Drivers can find parking faster and easier. Parking control officers can detect parking violations and improve their enforcement effectiveness.\\xa0 \\n BENEFITS\\xa0 \\n CLEANER ENVIRONMENT & LESS FRUSTRATION \\n The more you drive, the more will be the emissions from your car, and the more polluted the environment will become. Smart parking solutions can reduce emissions by up to  30% . slots is not only a waste of time and fuel – it can be acutely stressful too. \\xa0\\xa0 \\n OPTIMAL USAGE OF PARKING SPACES \\nIn a normal parking regime, it is impossible to ensure that the parking facilities available are being efficiently utilized. Due to lack of information, some slots might remain empty – but drivers might not know about them. With the real-time information from parking sensors, that problem goes out of the window. \\xa0 \\n MORE FUEL SAVINGS \\nWhen parking slots are found quickly, extra driving is not required – and hence, less fuel/gas gets used up by cars. Experts from the field of IoT have estimated that this fuel-savings are likely to reach  0.22 million gallons  by 2030, and a massive  0.3 million gallons  by 2050. \\xa0 \\n GREATER REVENUE & PAY AS YOU USE \\nThe real-time management and intelligent decision-making capabilities help in generating more revenue. The parking meters and billing providers collaborate to notify the users about the total parking fees they have to pay.

This is the main difference to the available ModBus Bridges for LoRaWAN.\\xa0 The IQNEXUS ModBus Transceiver is available in a powered version ( 10-30 Volt DC ) or as a battery version with up to 6 D-Cell Lithium batteries to drive the ModBus device over a power controller. The ModBus Slave is turned off during the sleep period of the ModBus Transceiver. The attached picture shows an example with a multi branch power meter. Up to 32 current modules can read 96 energy values. The power meter is not part of this offer.',\n",

Up to now, the consequence of this type of incident is a service breakdown - without any prior information - that is reported a few hours after its occurrence.

Batteries as stand-alone units and back-up power supplies are used in all industrial businesses and are considered as a weak point of any industrial process.\\xa0 Telecommunication cabinets, secured controlled access, rental tools, temporary light indicators, evacuation alarms, data storage, mobile electrical generators…all these systems use back-up power solutions ; all are critical assets.

This information – or alerts- allows the maintenance operator to react quickly and to plan a curative action before service loss. IDIAG Battery is made of a Cloud solution reporting the status and events of the asset, an autonomous sensor connected to the battery itself (or the UPS) and a wireless connection through the IoT network such as Sigfox or LoRaWan. The recorded data analysis also gives a diagnosis of the vital points of the battery as well as the detection of deep discharges and its end-of-life.

This functionalitiy enables users to monitor various parameters and to retrieve data, which was not possible before. By means of this, users have more insights into their processes, which enables to optimize and restructure (industrial) processes.

This offer is particularly startup oriented as a way to help them to demonstrate and experiment with no investment cost in the technology.\\xa0 \\n Depending on deployed number of devices, our technology is under IP retribution per device (one shot) and per year for communication/api services including maintenance. \\n We are providing a solution optimized for power consumption even in low GPS coverage situations. Foxtrackr behaviour is on demand based on your application need, configuration (and reconfiguration) is also possible remotly. Communication is bidirectionnal.\\xa0 \\n The modularity and the compact form factor allow to integrate it in different ways and form factor. We are fully able to create custom behavior depending on your need in our firmware. \\n Autonomy can run from 1 year to 15 days depends on the desired configuration on a simple small 350mAh battery. \\n We are also expert on providing solar power solution with no battery limit based on a single small solar panel. A new version dedicated for this use will be soon released and add in our product list. \\n'],\n",

       "   \"The 500 Series is broad portfolio of air/gas, liquid and surface temperature probes that use Honeywell's NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. Thermistors can be very effective in sensing temperatures of gases, liquids or solids because of their enhanced sensitivity. These small, easy to install probe assemblies support and position the thermistor elements within the media to be monitored as well as protect the thermistors against damage in use or handling. The assemblies also help direct thermal or fluid flow evenly across the thermistors for accurate temperature sensing. The enhanced reliability, precision and stability of the 500 Series products allow the customer greater flexibility in temperature monitoring and control. The wide operating temperature range is -60 °C to 300 °C [-76 °F to 572 °F] provides application flexibility. The 500 Series is available in a wide variety of housing styles and materials, R-T (Resistance-Temperature) curves, mounting methods, mechanical interface, electrical interface and connector types to meet most applications. In addition to custom configurations, a variety of existing designs is available. Honeywell also offers RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) technology that may be packaged into probe assemblies for similar applications that may require an RTD linear output instead of an NTC thermistor output.               \",\n",

The idea behind this device is that you can connect any device with an analog output. You can configure the device for two analog Inputs either as 0-10V, 0-20mA or PT1000 input. The data were transmitted or received from any LoRaWAN network, for example in Switzerland trough the public network of Swisscom. Ideally suited for a wide range of applications such as building automation, condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, security, healthcare, smart city and many more. The compact Size, the outdoor housing and the externally antenna are perfect for outdoor use. The device mounted outdoor gives extra spare if you have bad network coverage. The Input power with 10 to 30 VDC needs to come externally, therefore you don’t have to think about battery lifetime. After the installation, there is an easy procedure with a pushbutton inside the device. So you can check directly if you have coverage or not after the installation of the device. The status LED’s shows the device status and flashes if a new message is sent or received. Over the LoRaWAN network you can setup the send interval, means you can change the interval every time the device sends an uplink message. A big point is, that the device has inside a USB connection for very easy setup and integration into your LoRaWAN network. Of course, you can use the LoRa AI device with our comtac cloud. There you have the possibilities to send periodically measurement reports or alarm messages. We do also provide cloud our solution with your company logo or we install the software on your server.

       "   \"The 500 Series is broad portfolio of air/gas, liquid and surface temperature probes that use Honeywell's NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors. Thermistors can be very effective in sensing temperatures of gases, liquids or solids because of their enhanced sensitivity. These small, easy to install probe assemblies support and position the thermistor elements within the media to be monitored as well as protect the thermistors against damage in use or handling. The assemblies also help direct thermal or fluid flow evenly across the thermistors for accurate temperature sensing. The enhanced reliability, precision and stability of the 500 Series products allow the customer greater flexibility in temperature monitoring and control. The wide operating temperature range is -60 °C to 300 °C [-76 °F to 572 °F] provides application flexibility. The 500 Series is available in a wide variety of housing styles and materials, R-T (Resistance-Temperature) curves, mounting methods, mechanical interface, electrical interface and connector types to meet most applications. In addition to custom configurations, a variety of existing designs is available. Honeywell also offers RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) technology that may be packaged into probe assemblies for similar applications that may require an RTD linear output instead of an NTC thermistor output.               \",\n",

This current can be expressed as a voltage by passing it through a resistor.               ',\n",

This wireless smart-emitter device connects directly to the DC latching solenoid of the valve while providing wireless connectivity up to 15+km (10+ miles) distance from the Control Room or the irrigation controller even through obstacles. The STREGA wireless Smart-Emitter is provided within an IP68 enclosure. Connectivity to the solenoid is made through two wires. These wires are passing through a sealing gland to ensure complete waterproofing. Two extra Digital Inputs can be associated to the control of the valve for flow monitoring or any alarm status. The vast majority of the irrigation valve suppliers offer DC latching solenoids as a retrofit for their AC valves for applications where the irrigation controller is powered by batteries. Such retrofit solenoid is usually low cost (10-15US$). With its ultra-low-power consumption, the STREGA wireless Smart-Emitter can operate on batteries during 5-10 years* (calculation based on 3 irrigation periods/day – all year long) and through extreme long distances from the gateway/concentrator. LoRaWAN technology provides an exceptional obstacles penetration even in urban or sub-urban areas. The device is powered by two Lithium batteries but one can also use an external power source like a micro solar panel to power the emitter for unlimited time operation. The STREGA wireless Smart-Emitter permits to forget laying cables from the irrigation controller to the valve and offers a unique identification key combined with full encrypted wireless data for secure Open/Close control.
